## About Me 

I code, atleast sometimes. I code in Python, C & C++. I am constantly learning new coding languages, currently I am learning Java & NodeJS.
Most of my work is private, because I prefer developing alone.

I have some experince with a lot of APIs, I am looking to work on an API wrapper in C/C++ or Python
